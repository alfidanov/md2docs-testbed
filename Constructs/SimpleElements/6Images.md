# Images Use Cases

![VMware workstation alt text!](../images/tn-workstation-pro-16.jpg "VMware workstation")

## Linking Images

To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.

[![An old rock in the desert](../images/tn-workstation-pro-16.jpg "VMware Image")](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/images/GUID-5EB66614-1EE8-4F39-8C8B-1E97EEE76791-high.png)


## Image references from the root of the repo:

Example: '/md2docs-testbed/images/tn-workstation-pro-16.jpg'

![VMware workstation alt text!](/md2docs-testbed/images/tn-workstation-pro-16.jpg "VMware workstation")


Is this even a valid image syntax?
