Use the PXF HDFS Connector to read JSON-format data. This section describes how to use PXF to access JSON data in HDFS, including how to create and query an external table that references a JSON file in the HDFS data store.

## <a id="prereq"></a>Prerequisites

Ensure that you have met the PXF Hadoop [Prerequisites](access_hdfs.html#hadoop_prereq) before you attempt to read data from HDFS.

## <a id="hdfsjson_work"></a>Working with JSON Data

JSON is a text-based data-interchange format. JSON data is typically stored in a file with a `.json` suffix. 

A `.json` file will contain a collection of objects. A JSON object is a collection of unordered name/value pairs. A value can be a string, a number, true, false, null, or an object or an array. You can define nested JSON objects and arrays.

Sample JSON data file content:

``` json
  {
    "created_at":"MonSep3004:04:53+00002013",
    "id_str":"384529256681725952",
    "user": {
      "id":31424214,
      "location":"COLUMBUS"
    },
    "coordinates":{
      "type":"Point",
      "values":[
         13,
         99
      ]
    }
  }
```
